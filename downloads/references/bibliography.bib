	abstract = {Our research aims at understanding the various forms of participation in Open Source Software ({OSS}) design, seen as distributed design in online spaces of actions–discussion, implementation, and boundary between these spaces. We propose a methodology—based on situated analyses of a formal design process used in the Python project—to identify the distribution of actual roles (implementation, interactive, group, and design oriented) performed by participants into and between the spaces (defining boundary spaces). This notion of roles is grounded in collaborative design activities performed online by participants. This way, our findings complete the core-periphery model of participation in {OSS}. Concerning the distribution of roles between spaces, we reveal a map of participation in {OSS}: The majority of participants are pure discussants, but all participants in the implementation spaces do also act in the discussion space, and few participants act at boundary spaces. Concerning the distribution of roles between participants in the discussion space, we reveal that interactions are structured by a central hub (occupied by key participants) and that, whereas design-oriented roles are spread among all participants, group-oriented roles are performed by one or two participants in the respective spaces and at their boundary. Finally, combination of roles reveals five individual profiles performed by participants. Our approach could be extended to other design situations to explore relationships between forms of participation—in particular, those revealing use-oriented contributions—performance, and quality of the design product. Finally, it could be a basis for specifying tools to monitor and manage community activity for both research issues and support of online community.},

This process is particularly important in open source projects to ensure the quality of contributions submitted by the community, however, the review process can promote or discourage these contributions. In this paper, we study the patch lifecycle of the Mozilla Fire fox project. The model of a patch lifecycle was extracted from both the qualitative evidence of the individual processes (interviews and discussions with developers), and the quantitative assessment of the Mozilla process and practice. We contrast the lifecycle of a patch in pre- and post-rapid release development. A quantitative comparison showed that while the patch lifecycle remains mostly unchanged after switching to rapid release, the patches submitted by casual contributors are disproportionately more likely to be abandoned compared to core contributors. This suggests that patches from casual developers should receive extra care to both ensure quality and encourage future community contributions.},

	abstract = {Previous taxonomies of software change have focused on the purpose of the change (i.e., the why) rather than the underlying mechanisms. This paper proposes a taxonomy of software change based on characterizing the mechanisms of change and the factors that influence these mechanisms. The ultimate goal of this taxonomy is to provide a framework that positions concrete tools, formalisms and methods within the domain of software evolution. Such a framework would considerably ease comparison between the various mechanisms of change. It would also allow practitioners to identify and evaluate the relevant tools, methods and formalisms for a particular change scenario. As an initial step towards this taxonomy, the paper presents a framework that can be used to characterize software change support tools and to identify the factors that impact on the use of these tools. The framework is evaluated by applying it to three different change support tools and by comparing these tools based on this analysis. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Open data are currently a hot topic and are associated with realising ambitions such as a more transparent and efficient government, solving societal problems, and increasing economic value. To describe and monitor the state of open data in countries and organisations, several open data assessment frameworks were developed. Despite high scores in these assessment frameworks, the actual (re)use of open government data ({OGD}) fails to live up to its expectations. Our review of existing open data assessment frameworks reveals that these only cover parts of the open data ecosystem. We have developed a framework, which assesses open data supply, open data governance, and open data user characteristics holistically. This holistic open data framework assesses the maturity of the open data ecosystem and proves to be a useful tool to indicate which aspects of the open data ecosystem are successful and which aspects require attention. Our initial assessment in the Netherlands indicates that the traditional geographical data perform significantly better than non-geographical data, such as healthcare data. Therefore, open geographical data policies in the Netherlands may provide useful cues for other {OGD} strategies.},

	abstract = {Throughout its short history, software development has been characterized by harmful disconnects between important activities e.g., planning, development and implementation. The problem is further exacerbated by the episodic and infrequent performance of activities such as planning, testing, integration and releases. Several emerging phenomena reflect attempts to address these problems. For example, the Enterprise Agile concept has emerged as a recognition that the benefits of agile software development will be sub- optimal if not complemented by an agile approach in related organizational function such as finance and {HR}. Continuous integration is a practice which has emerged to eliminate discontinuities between development and deployment. In a similar vein, the recent emphasis on {DevOps} recognizes that the integration between software development and its operational deployment needs to be a continuous one. We argue a similar continuity is required between business strategy and development, {BizDev} being the term we coin for this. These disconnects are even more problematic given the need for reliability and resilience in the complex and data-intensive systems being developed today. Drawing on the lean concept of flow, we identify a number of continuous activities which are important for software development in today’s context. These activities include continuous planning, continuous integration, continuous deployment, continuous delivery, continuous verification, continuous testing, continuous compliance,continuous security, continuous use, continuous trust, continuous run-time monitoring, continuous improvement (both process and product), all underpinned by continuous innovation. We use the umbrella term, ``Continuous *'' (continuous star) to identify this family of continuous activities.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the impacts of continuous delivery practices in organizations. Continuous delivery is a set of practices designed to optimize the process of taking changes from version control to production or release to manufacturing. Key elements include comprehensive use of version control, automation of the test and deployment process, and the application of continuous integration to rapidly validate the correctness of every change through running the automated build and test process. When viewed through the lens of organizational capabilities theory, {CD} is an inside-out spanning process. We propose that the use of {CD} in organizations affects factors that impact the tech workforce today (e.g., perceived burnout and deployment pain), and software delivery performance (e.g., change fail rates and {IT} performance). We also propose that it indirectly influences organizational performance through {IT} performance (which is itself a spanning process). We empirically test our model with survey data collected from 4,976 respondents around the world, and find that our hypotheses are supported. The paper’s implications for research and practice are discussed.},

	abstract = {Context: Test-driven development ({TDD}) is an agile practice claimed to improve the quality of a software product, as well as the productivity of its developers. A previous study (i.e., baseline experiment) at the University of Oulu (Finland) compared {TDD} to a test-last development ({TLD}) approach through a randomized controlled trial. The results failed to support the claims. Goal: We want to validate the original study results by replicating it at the University of Basilicata (Italy), using a different design. Method: We replicated the baseline experiment, using a crossover design, with 21 graduate students. We kept the settings and context as close as possible to the baseline experiment. In order to limit researchers bias, we involved two other sites ({UPM}, Spain, and Brunel, {UK}) to conduct blind analysis of the data. Results: The Kruskal-Wallis tests did not show any significant difference between {TDD} and {TLD} in terms of testing effort (p-value = .27), external code quality (p-value = .82), and developers' productivity (p-value = .83). Nevertheless, our data revealed a difference based on the order in which {TDD} and {TLD} were applied, though no carry over effect. Conclusions: We verify the baseline study results, yet our results raises concerns regarding the selection of experimental objects, particularly with respect to their interaction with the order in which of treatments are applied. We recommend future studies to survey the tasks used in experiments evaluating {TDD}. Finally, to lower the cost of replication studies and reduce researchers' bias, we encourage other research groups to adopt similar multi-site blind analysis approach described in this paper.},

	shorttitle = {Developer initiation and social interactions in {OSS}},
	abstract = {Maintaining a productive and collaborative team of developers is essential to Open Source Software ({OSS}) success, and hinges upon the trust inherent among the team. Whether a project participant is initiated as a committer is a function of both his technical contributions and also his social interactions with other project participants. One’s online social footprint is arguably easier to ascertain and gather than one’s technical contributions e.g., gathering patch submission information requires mining multiple sources with different formats, and then merging the aliases from these sources. In contrast to prior work, where patch submission was found to be an essential ingredient to achieving committer status, here we investigate the extent to which the likelihood of achieving that status can be modeled solely as a social network phenomenon. For 6 different Apache Software Foundation {OSS} projects we compile and integrate a set of social measures of the communications network among {OSS} project participants and a set of technical measures, i.e., {OSS} developers’ patch submission activities. We use these sets to predict whether a project participant will become a committer, and to characterize their socialization patterns around the time of becoming committer. We find that the social network metrics, in particular the amount of two-way communication a person participates in, are more significant predictors of one’s likelihood to becoming a committer. Further, we find that this is true to the extent that other predictors, e.g., patch submission info, need not be included in the models. In addition, we show that future committers are easy to identify with great fidelity when using the first three months of data of their social activities. Moreover, only the first month of their social links are a very useful predictor, coming within 10 \% of the three month data’s predictions. Interestingly, we find that on average, for each project, one’s level of socialization ramps up before the time of becoming a committer. After obtaining committer status, their social behavior is more individualized, falling into few distinct modes of behavior. In a significant number of projects, immediately after the initiation there is a notable social cooling-off period. Finally, we find that it is easier to become a committer earlier in the projects life cycle than it is later as the project matures. These results should provide insight on the social nature of gaining trust and advancing in status in distributed projects.},

In this work, we explore how pull-based software development works, first on the {GHTorrent} corpus and then on a carefully selected sample of 291 projects. We find that the pull request model offers fast turnaround, increased opportunities for community engagement and decreased time to incorporate contributions. We show that a relatively small number of factors affect both the decision to merge a pull request and the time to process it. We also examine the reasons for pull request rejection and find that technical ones are only a small minority.},

This work focuses on the role of the integrator and investigates working habits and challenges alike. We set up an exploratory qualitative study involving a large-scale survey of 749 integrators, to which we add quantitative data from the integrator's project. Our results provide insights into the factors they consider in their decision making process to accept or reject a contribution. Our key findings are that integrators struggle to maintain the quality of their projects and have difficulties with prioritizing contributions that are to be merged. Our insights have implications for practitioners who wish to use or improve their pull-based development process, as well as for researchers striving to understand the theoretical implications of the pull-based model in software development.},

Here we present a case study of software development practices in four open-source scientific codes over a period of nine years, characterizing the evolution of their respective development teams, their scientific productivity, and the adoption (or discontinuation) of specific software engineering practises as the team size changes. We show that the transient nature of the development team results in the adoption of different development strategies. We relate measures of publication output to accumulated numbers of developers and find that for the projects considered the time-scale for returns on expended development effort is approximately three years. We discuss the implications of our findings for evaluating the performance of research software development, and in general any computationally oriented scientific project.},

To fill this void, we investigated global {WMSs} resources and performed distributed performance monitoring of these services. This paper explicates a distributed monitoring framework that was used to monitor 46,296 {WMSs} continuously for over one year and a crawling method to discover these {WMSs}. We analyzed server locations, provider types, themes, the spatiotemporal coverage of map layers and the service versions for 41,703 valid {WMSs}. Furthermore, we appraised the stability and performance of basic operations for 1210 selected {WMSs} (i.e., {GetCapabilities} and {GetMap}). We discuss the major reasons for request errors and performance issues, as well as the relationship between service response times and the spatiotemporal distribution of client monitoring sites. This paper will help service providers, end users and developers of standards to grasp the status of global {WMS} resources, as well as to understand the adoption status of {OGC} standards. The conclusions drawn in this paper can benefit geospatial resource discovery, service performance evaluation and guide service performance improvements.},

	abstract = {In this project we have outlined a list of contributor roles identified by the Force 11 Attribution Working Group. Contributor roles from existing taxonomies were leveraged ({CRediT}) and further enhanced with more finely-resolved contributor roles based on an in-depth investigation of activities and outputs. We have also collated and reviewed existing efforts on scholarly contribution taxonomies to determine their unique aspects, and how they complement each other. We reviewed the landscape of taxonomies and systems in order to compare and contrast key types of contributions.  We also considered the objectives needed to create a contributorship model that is robust enough to cover various fields of research, and specific enough to adequately describe contribution in a meaningful way.We found there to be a diverse landscape of projects and groups working in this area, though each with its own perspective. A brief outline of the coverage, goals and relevant factors of these projects or groups is provided. Several projects were identified as being relevant to this inquiry, including Contributor Roles Taxonomy Project ({CRediT}), {VIVO}-{ISF} ontology, Provenance ({PROV}), the Becker Model and other impact frameworks, Transitive Credit, Academic Careers Understood through Measurement and Norms ({ACUMEN} Project), and the Scholarly Contributions and Roles Ontology ({SCoRO}). Additionally, several working groups were identified: Global Alliance for Genomics and Health ({GA}4GH), National Information Standards Organization ({NISO}), and the Force 11 Attribution Working Group.Through the in-depth study of different contribution roles in the scholarly process, we were able to better understand how these contributions might be structured – in terms of a particular output (manuscript, dataset, etc.) and also contributions to the project as a whole.  Moreover, we developed a 2-level hierarchy to enable more complete representation of these roles through major classes such as author, communication, data, {IP}, project and team management, regulatory administration, software development, and so on.While there are projects and ongoing efforts to better understand the diverse roles that professionals take on when contributing to the scholarly ecosystem, it is clear that more work is needed to fully explore the area of contributorship roles. Several leaders in this area have proposed projects to define an informatics infrastructure that enables the collection and dissemination on contributor attribution data to various stakeholder audiences. Projects of that nature bring excitement and expectation, as we wait to see where they will take us and how greatly they will impact the scholarly ecosystem. Perhaps most important is the need to accomplish this work in an open, collaborative manner, leveraging data standards along the way to enable interoperability and integration with existing architectures.},

We asked people specifically about \&ldquo;research software\&rdquo; which we defined as:


\&ldquo;Software that is used to generate, process or analyse results that you intend to appear in a publication (either in a journal, conference paper, monograph, book or thesis).\&nbsp;Research software can be anything from a few lines of code written by yourself, to a professionally developed software package.\&nbsp;Software that does not generate, process or analyse results - such as word processing software, or the use of a web search - does not count as \&lsquo;research software\&rsquo; for the purposes of this survey.\&rdquo;


We contacted 1,000 randomly selected researchers at each of 15 Russell Group universities. From the 15,000 invitations to complete the survey, we received 417 responses \&ndash; a rate of 3\% which is fairly normal for a blind survey.\&nbsp;We used Google Forms to collect responses.

The responses have good\&nbsp;representation from across the disciplines, seniorities and genders. This is a statistically significant number of responses that can be used to represent\&nbsp;the views of people in research-intensive universities in the {UK}.

An overview of the data is available on the worksheet \&quot;Summary data\&quot;. Responses to questions are\&nbsp;ordered by unique respondent {ID}. Please read the \&quot;{README}\&quot; worksheet for additional information about the collection and processing of this data.

Scientists share their discoveries with others by the ways of publishing paper, data and software. It promotes the development of research. With the increasing number of scientific software and more and more open source communities springing up, software selection becomes an urgent issue in sharing. In this paper, from the users' perspectives, we first propose a collaborative provenance model, which is designed to record the collaborative information between users and software. Then, drawing on ethnographic method, we explore the elements influencing the choice of users, and quantify them. On that basis, an algorithm is introduced to select the software for each process in workflow. For the whole workflow, a composition selection algorithm is presented.},

	abstract = {When they seek software for a task, how do people go about finding it? Past research found that searching the Web, asking colleagues, and reading papers have been the predominant approaches---but is it still true today, given the popularity of Facebook, Stack Overflow, {GitHub}, and similar sites? In addition, when users do look for software, what criteria do they use? And finally, if resources such as improved software catalogs were to be developed, what kind of information would people want in them? These questions motivated our cross-sectional survey of scientists and engineers. We sought to understand the practices and experiences of people looking for ready-to-run software as well as people looking for source code. The results show that even in our highly educated sample of people, the relatively unsophisticated approaches of relying on general Web searches, the opinions of colleagues, and the literature remain the most popular approaches overall. However, software developers are more likely than non-developers to search in community sites such as Stack Overflow and {GitHub}, even when seeking ready-to-run software rather than source code. We also found that when searching for source code, poor documentation was the most common reason for being unable to reuse the code found. Our results also reveal a variety of characteristics that matter to people searching for software, and thus can inform the development of future resources to help people find software more effectively.},

	shorttitle = {Challenges of shared decision-making},
	abstract = {Context
Agile software development changes the nature of collaboration, coordination, and communication in software projects.
Objective
Our objective was to understand the challenges of shared decision-making in agile software development teams.
Method
We designed a multiple case study consisting of four projects in two software product companies that recently adopted Scrum. We collected data in semi-structured interviews, through participant observations, and from process artifacts.
Results
We identified three main challenges to shared decision-making in agile software development: alignment of strategic product plans with iteration plans, allocation of development resources, and performing development and maintenance tasks in teams.
Conclusion
Agile software development requires alignment of decisions on the strategic, tactical, and operational levels in order to overcome these challenges. Agile development also requires a transition from specialized skills to redundancy of functions and from rational to naturalistic decision-making. This takes time; the case companies needed from one to two years to change from traditional, hierarchical decision-making to shared decision-making in software development projects.},

	abstract = {The integrity of knowledge that emerges from research is based on individual and collective adherence to core values of objectivity, honesty, openness, fairness, accountability, and stewardship. Integrity in science means that the organizations in which research is conducted encourage those involved to exemplify these values in every step of the research process. Understanding the dynamics that support – or distort – practices that uphold the integrity of research by all participants ensures that the research enterprise advances knowledge.

The 1992 report Responsible Science: Ensuring the Integrity of the Research Process evaluated issues related to scientific responsibility and the conduct of research. It provided a valuable service in describing and analyzing a very complicated set of issues, and has served as a crucial basis for thinking about research integrity for more than two decades. However, as experience has accumulated with various forms of research misconduct, detrimental research practices, and other forms of misconduct, as subsequent empirical research has revealed more about the nature of scientific misconduct, and because technological and social changes have altered the environment in which science is conducted, it is clear that the framework established more than two decades ago needs to be updated.

Responsible Science served as a valuable benchmark to set the context for this most recent analysis and to help guide the committee’s thought process. The Integrity of Science identifies best practices in research and recommends practical options for discouraging and addressing research misconduct and detrimental research practices.},

	abstract = {A methodology for the self-assessment of the socio-economic impact of Software-as-a-Service and Internet of Services research projects is presented in the context of {EU}-funded research. The {SEQUOIA} methodology was developed by assessing 30 existing projects in close collaboration with them. This process was documented to provide a basis for future research projects to apply the methodology on their own. The model and the empirical findings are discussed in detail, focussing on five projects that qualified as ‘best practices’. The main findings are that an ‘impact assessment culture’ needs to be cultivated, encouraged, and strengthened by the European Commission and all the stakeholders. The five projects that scored highest generated a fairly good financial return over the total projects’ output lifetime and showed a genuine attention for non-monetizable impacts such as knowledge creation and sharing, improvement in working routines, and social capital. Relative to the other projects, the five best practices demonstrated knowledge of the needs of their stakeholders and of their expectations, and engaged with them from the very beginning of their technology development activities. To integrate the assessment methodology within each project, its partners need to feel that they ‘own’ it, and that it has been optimized for its specific institutional, organizational, and epistemological requirements. We therefore recommend the inclusion in project consortia of socio-economic experts who are able to translate the {ICT} research language into measurable (potential) socio-economic impacts. {SEQUOIA}’s assumption that in the development of an effective socio-economic impact assessment methodology it is important to integrate the social and economic dimensions of potential impact was verified and validated through an ex post rationalization informed by economic anthropology, the usefulness of our quantitative model, and empirical evidence obtained through in-depth qualitative–quantitative data gathering techniques.},

	shorttitle = {Guidelines for conducting systematic mapping studies in software engineering},
	abstract = {Context
Systematic mapping studies are used to structure a research area, while systematic reviews are focused on gathering and synthesizing evidence. The most recent guidelines for systematic mapping are from 2008. Since that time, many suggestions have been made of how to improve systematic literature reviews ({SLRs}). There is a need to evaluate how researchers conduct the process of systematic mapping and identify how the guidelines should be updated based on the lessons learned from the existing systematic maps and {SLR} guidelines.
Objective
To identify how the systematic mapping process is conducted (including search, study selection, analysis and presentation of data, etc.); to identify improvement potentials in conducting the systematic mapping process and updating the guidelines accordingly.
Method
We conducted a systematic mapping study of systematic maps, considering some practices of systematic review guidelines as well (in particular in relation to defining the search and to conduct a quality assessment).
Results
In a large number of studies multiple guidelines are used and combined, which leads to different ways in conducting mapping studies. The reason for combining guidelines was that they differed in the recommendations given.
Conclusion
The most frequently followed guidelines are not sufficient alone. Hence, there was a need to provide an update of how to conduct systematic mapping studies. New guidelines have been proposed consolidating existing findings.},

When those steps have been described in sufficient detail that others can retrace the steps and obtain similar results, the research is said to be reproducible. Computers play a vital role in many research disciplines and present both opportunities and challenges for reproducibility. Computers can be programmed to execute analysis tasks, and those programs can be repeated and shared with others. The deterministic nature of most computer programs means that the same analysis tasks, applied to the same data, will often produce the same outputs. However, in practice, computational findings often cannot be reproduced because of complexities in how software is packaged, installed, and executed—and because of limitations associated with how scientists document analysis steps. Many tools and techniques are available to help overcome these challenges; here we describe seven such strategies. With a broad scientific audience in mind, we describe the strengths and limitations of each approach, as well as the circumstances under which each might be applied. No single strategy is sufficient for every scenario; thus we emphasize that it is often useful to combine approaches.},

In contrast to industry, where reviews are typically assigned to specific individuals, changes are broadcast to hundreds of potentially interested stakeholders. Despite concerns that reviews may be ignored, or that discussions will deadlock because too many uninformed stakeholders are involved, we find that this approach works well in practice. In this paper, we describe an empirical study to investigate the mechanisms and behaviours that developers use to find code changes they are competent to review. We also explore how stakeholders interact with one another during the review process. We manually examine hundreds of reviews across five high profile {OSS} projects. Our findings provide insights into the simple, community-wide techniques that developers use to effectively manage large quantities of reviews. The themes that emerge from our study are enriched and validated by interviewing long-serving core developers.},

	abstract = {Context: The increase in the number of qualitative and mixed-methods research published in software engineering has created an opportunity for further knowledge generation through the synthesis of studies with similar aims. This is particularly true in the research on human aspects because the phenomena of interest are often better understood using qualitative research. However, the use of qualitative synthesis methods is not widespread and worked examples of their consistent application in software engineering are needed. Objective: To explore the use of meta-ethnography in the synthesis of empirical studies in software engineering through an example using studies about the relations between personality and software team processes. Methods: We applied the seven phases of meta-ethnography on a set of articles selected from a previously developed systematic review, to assess the appropriateness of meta-ethnography in this domain with respect to ease of use, and usefulness and reliability of results. Results: Common concepts were identified through reading and interpreting the studies. Then, second order translations were built and used to synthesize a model of the relationships between personality and software team processes. Conclusions: Meta-ethnography is adequate in the synthesis of empirical studies even in the context of mixed-methods studies. However, we believe that the method should not be used to synthesize studies that are too disparate to avoid the development of gross generalizations, which tend to be fruitless and are contrary to the central tenets of interpretive research.},

	abstract = {Context
Numerous open source software projects are based on volunteers collaboration and require a continuous influx of newcomers for their continuity. Newcomers face barriers that can lead them to give up. These barriers hinder both developers willing to make a single contribution and those willing to become a project member.
Objective
This study aims to identify and classify the barriers that newcomers face when contributing to open source software projects.
Method
We conducted a systematic literature review of papers reporting empirical evidence regarding the barriers that newcomers face when contributing to open source software ({OSS}) projects. We retrieved 291 studies by querying 4 digital libraries. Twenty studies were identified as primary. We performed a backward snowballing approach, and searched for other papers published by the authors of the selected papers to identify potential studies. Then, we used a coding approach inspired by open coding and axial coding procedures from Grounded Theory to categorize the barriers reported by the selected studies.
Results
We identified 20 studies providing empirical evidence of barriers faced by newcomers to {OSS} projects while making a contribution. From the analysis, we identified 15 different barriers, which we grouped into five categories: social interaction, newcomers’ previous knowledge, finding a way to start, documentation, and technical hurdles. We also classified the problems with regard to their origin: newcomers, community, or product.
Conclusion
The results are useful to researchers and {OSS} practitioners willing to investigate or to implement tools to support newcomers. We mapped technical and non-technical barriers that hinder newcomers’ first contributions. The most evidenced barriers are related to socialization, appearing in 75\% (15 out of 20) of the studies analyzed, with a high focus on interactions in mailing lists (receiving answers and socialization with other members). There is a lack of in-depth studies on technical issues, such as code issues. We also noticed that the majority of the studies relied on historical data gathered from software repositories and that there was a lack of experiments and qualitative studies in this area.},

The purpose of this study was to understand what factors lead to software projects being well sustained over the long run, focusing on software created with funding from the {US} National Science Foundation ({NSF}) and/or used by researchers funded by the {NSF}. We surveyed {NSF}-funded researchers and performed in-depth studies of software projects that have been sustained over many years. Successful projects generally used open-source software licenses and employed good software engineering practices and test practices. However, many projects that have not been well sustained over time also met these criteria. The features that stood out about successful projects included deeply committed leadership and some sort of user forum or conference at least annually. In some cases, software project leaders have employed multiple financial strategies over the course of a decades-old software project. Such well-sustained software is used in major distributed {CI} projects that support thousands of users, and this software is critical to the operation of major distributed {CI} facilities in the {US}. The findings of our study identify some characteristics of software that is relevant to the {NSF}-supported research community, and that has been sustained over many years.},

Our position is that by following a rational design process, with the right tool support, desirable software qualities such as traceability, verifiability, and reproducibility, can be achieved for scientific software. We have begun development of a framework, Drasil, to put this into practice. Our aims are to ensure complete traceability, to facilitate agility in the face of ever changing scientific computing projects, and ensure that software artifacts can be easily and quickly extracted from Drasil. In particular, we are very interested in certifiable software and in easy re-certification. Using an example-based approach to our prototype implementation, we have already seen many benefits. Drasil keeps all software artifacts (requirements, design, code, tests, build scripts, documentation, etc.) synchronized with each other. This allows for reuse of common concepts across projects, and aids in the verification of software. It is our hope that Drasil will lead to the development of higher quality software at lower cost over the long term.},

Over the past 10 years, we’ve seen some big changes in the marketplace for engineers. There are far more startups competing for talent, and established companies beyond the tech world have realized the value of having strong engineering teams. We’ve also seen an increase in the supply of engineers who are looking for jobs. Between students realizing the value of a tech degree, people changing careers, and bootcamps rapidly churning out graduates, the mix of types of people who write software has changed. Most of the people I knew writing software in 2007 had tech or tech-adjacent (math, physics) degrees. These days many teams have a mix of those with tech degrees, those who have switched careers into technology, and even some without degrees at all/

All of this is to say, playing to 2007 nerd stereotypes is not always a good way to build an engineering team in 2017. What {DO} engineers want? I believe that you have 3 important axes to play with: money, purpose, and respect. Depending on your company, you can lean more on one to cover problems with the others, but you have to find your balance.

	abstract = {Prior characterizations of open source projects have been based on the model of a community-founded project. More recently, a second model has emerged, where organizations spinout internally developed code to a public forum. Based on field work on open source projects, we compare the lifecycle differences between these two models. We identify problems unique to spinout projects, particularly in attracting and building an external community. We illustrate these issues with a feasibility analysis of a proposed open source project based on {VistA}, the primary healthcare information system of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. This example illuminates the complexities of building a community after a code base has been developed and suggests that open source software can be used to transfer technology to the private sector.},

	abstract = {Large, production quality distributed systems still fail periodically, and do so sometimes catastrophically, where most or all users experience an outage or data loss. We present the result of a comprehensive study investigating 198 randomly selected, user-reported failures that occurred on Cassandra, {HBase}, Hadoop Distributed File System ({HDFS}), Hadoop {MapReduce}, and Redis, with the goal of understanding how one or multiple faults eventually evolve into a user-visible failure. We found that from a testing point of view, almost all failures require only 3 or fewer nodes to reproduce, which is good news considering that these services typically run on a very large number of nodes. However, multiple inputs are needed to trigger the failures with the order between them being important. Finally, we found the error logs of these systems typically contain sufficient data on both the errors and the input events that triggered the failure, enabling the diagnose and the reproduction of the production failures. We found the majority of catastrophic failures could easily have been prevented by performing simple testing on error handling code - the last line of defense - even without an understanding of the software design. We extracted three simple rules from the bugs that have lead to some of the catastrophic failures, and developed a static checker, Aspirator, capable of locating these bugs. Over 30\% of the catastrophic failures would have been prevented had Aspirator been used and the identified bugs fixed. Running Aspirator on the code of 9 distributed systems located 143 bugs and bad practices that have been fixed or confirmed by the developers.},

This can lead to open source solutions being overlooked. Even when managers are alert to the potential of {OSS}, choosing viable software can pose difficulties. The {OSMM} was developed to help determine whether a given {OSS} application had been developed to the point at which it was ready for use for a given task, and how it compared with it peers.

http://linux.conf.au/schedule/present...
Does Open Source have a sustainable future? One of linux.conf.au
2017’s four keynote speakers, Nadia Eghbal will help you find out!

linux.conf.au’s focus in 2017 is The Future of Open Source, so we’re
delighted to welcome Nadia, a noted researcher on sustainability in
Open Source.

Nadia's talk examines the inherent tension
between keeping code free, and better supporting the people who
maintain that code. She'll focus on why the future of Open Source requires turning our attention from freedom of the user to freedom of the maintainer.

Originally from a venture capital background, in January 2016, Nadia
started investigating Open Source as the “digital infrastructure” upon
which the tech industry is built.

Her initial reports painted a worrying view of the sustainability of
Open Source software: Many Open Source projects – ones that form the
digital infrastructure that many big organisations in tech and
government rely upon – aren’t in very good shape. Most of Open Source
is not well-funded, and depends heavily on the contribution of free
time on the part of a small pool of maintainers.

She also highlighted that despite building their success on this
infrastructure, much of the leadership in the tech industry was
largely unaware of these issues.

This research culminated in Roads and Bridges: The Unseen Labor Behind
Our Digital Infrastructure, a 142-page report published by the Ford
Foundation, that highlights the scale of the problem:

› Everybody relies on shared code to write software, including
Fortune 500 companies, government, major software companies and
startups. In a world driven by technology, we are putting increased
demand on those who maintain our digital infrastructure. Yet because
these communities are not highly visible, the rest of the world has
been slow to notice.

› In the face of unprecedented demand, the costs of not supporting our
digital infrastructure are numerous. No individual company or
organisation is incentivised to address the public good problem alone.
'''

More recently, Nadia has joined {GitHub}, focusing on finding ways that
{GitHub} can empower open source maintainers to create and nurture
thriving, healthy open source projects.},
