    <p class="c2"><span class="c36">Code, software, and other such products are often developed in the course of publically-funded research. &ldquo;Code-wise&rdquo;, there is nothing special about these research products in themselves; however, unlike commercially-derived code and software, research products bear the additional burdens of reproducibility, publication, and preservation, because of the nature of the funding that produced them.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>The Federation for Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) recognizes the role code plays in contemporary research practices as well as the complex issues community members face when approaching technology-dependent research. With the cross-disciplinary nature of the ESIP membership, we feel well positioned to develop guidance and recommended practices for the Earth observation and geosciences communities in a way that recognizes the domain expertise within these communities and that supports the communities&rsquo; desire for improved practices around research code and software. </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Current discussions around code and software practices in the broader research community often do not include representations from either the Earth observation or geosciences communities. And while we agree that code is code in any domain, public or private, we believe that it is important that these discussions include a broad range of researchers, including faculty, research staff, developers, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Such inclusion is necessary to ensure that the practices evolving from these discussions have the broadest possible usage and application. Our goal is to develop meaningful and practical assessment procedures that address the concerns of all researchers, and to develop training and support networks for early career and future researchers.</span></p><h2 class="c2 c8" id="h.vljbal76mq9u"><span>Motivation</span></h2><p class="c2"><span>Our motivation for developing these guidelines is twofold. First, we recognize, both within our research communities and within funding agencies, that code is vital to many of our research activities. It is, therefore, crucial to support researchers, at all levels, in developing high quality code to meet the needs of these activities, and to continue to do so as capabilities and requirements grow in complexity and scale. We also have the additional burden to understand and support our research community practices.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Second</span><span>, with the increased focus on return on investment for grant-funded cyberinfrastructure and, perhaps more crucially, a new focus by funding agencies on &ldquo;time to science&rdquo;, we see renewed interest in evaluating the adoption and impact of cyberinfrastructure solutions. We stress the need to develop evaluation processes in ways that reflect current code outputs and that encourage adoption of development and management practices to support improved research outcomes and impact.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>This document will provide a broad overview of current development practices and provide guidelines for improving those practices. We will then discuss the relationship of these guidelines to the larger research development ecosystem as well as their limitations. We hope this discussion leads to equitable evaluation practices, and, more critically, to new approaches to supporting high quality, sustainable research development.</span></p>

    <h2 class="c2 c8" id="h.kzncxgycnjwc"><span>Background</span></h2><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>This work uses </span><span>the</span><span>&nbsp;criteria for research code developed by the </span><span class="c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://software.ac.uk/sites/default/files/SSI-SoftwareEvaluationCriteria.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1475132047339000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE4epGG49y6ZrFFLPkeeuGFMt2oiA">Software Sustainability Institute</a></span><span>&nbsp;(SSI, Jackson et al. 2011) and extends their use through a larger evaluation framework developed by ESIP in collaboration with NASA AIST to verify </span><span class="c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/scan/engineering/technology/txt_accordion1.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1475132047340000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFe4lPObwy0wvNX9vgcX8lrFpH2Ng">Technology Readiness Levels</a></span><span>&nbsp;(TRL, NASA 2012).

The guidelines outlined in this document will serve as the foundation for future assessment and training implementations.</span></p><h2 class="c2 c8" id="h.t69p8mskjiy9"><span>Developing Software Guidelines: A Community-driven Process</span></h2><p class="c2"><span>We began developing these guidelines by adapting the SSI&rsquo;s criteria so that they would better meet the diverse needs of the interdisciplinary ESIP community. During this process, we made a conscious effort to solicit input from active developers. Our aim was to have roughly even representation of developers on one hand and researchers, managers and/or principal investigators on the other. </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Formal revision of the initial draft was undertaken through three different activities. The first involved a remote sprint where ESIP members volunteered to review different sections of the original criteria based on their domain expertise and interest. The remote sprint ended with a half day workshop during the ESIP Summer Meeting, July 2016. The second activity involved community discussions with members of the Boulder Earth and Space Science Informatics Group (BESSIG). The last activity was the Joint EarthCube and ESIP Workshop on Software Assessment (Boulder, CO; June 2016). Two achievements that resulted from this workshop were, first, that the existing guidelines were revised and new guidelines for interoperability were established, and second, that EarthCube and ESIP&#39;s roles were established for addressing the larger EO and geoscience needs for improving both research code and software practices.</span></p><h2 class="c2 c8" id="h.ktnrb9wswuob"><span>What Is Research Code?</span></h2><p class="c2"><span>For our purposes, research code and research software are any code outputs developed through grant-funded activities. This understanding is broader and more inclusive than that found in more traditional &ldquo;science code&rdquo; definitions, and it is a necessary expansion for supporting the current needs of our research communities. Research code and research software are critical to many contemporary research activities (Hettrick et al. 2014). </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Here, we also make a distinction between research code and research software. Research code can be scripts, data processing or analysis workflows, or other codes developed to generate data, perform analyses, or perform other project-specific tasks leading to </span><span>artefacts</span><span>&nbsp;published through journal articles or otherwise. This kind of code is usually not intended for community adoption through open sourcing or public release, nor is it included as an explicit deliverable on a grant. The potential for long term support for these codes is low, but these codes are nevertheless important to the community for provenance and reproducibility, replicability and publication.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>For its part, research software is any code product, whether as scripts or as some packaged object, that is intended to be released for community adoption and use. Intention of release is not a complete description of what we mean by research software as we also include intentional design or systems understanding for a defined purpose. This software is most likely an explicit deliverable for a grant. These outputs are valuable for provenance and other community practices, and have the additional potential of longer term support through both ongoing maintenance by the research group or other contributors and through continued funding. </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>The distinctions here are related to the purpose of the release and the prospect for ongoing maintenance. In practice, these factors usually do not affect the guidance provided, and for most of this text, the terms research code and research software will be simplified to &ldquo;codes&rdquo;. However, there are certain circumstances in which the differences come into play, and these situations will be noted.</span></p><h2 class="c2 c8" id="h.6bi4jecr96n"><span>Community and Stakeholders</span></h2><p class="c2"><span>Our focus on assessment for verification and guided educational activities encompasses a wide range of stakeholders.

These groups range from well-supported institutions with dedicated developer teams to individual PIs with only part-time developer support, or with small teams of graduate students with varying levels of experience in software development. With that understanding in mind, we have structured this guidance to demonstrate worthwhile and concrete actions that can be taken to improve development practices within a given research group&rsquo;s current resource limitations. </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Over time, some individuals will take on different stakeholder roles at different stages of their academic careers, and their the educational goals will take on a different slant. They may find, for instance, that the skills that were adequate to manage code at the graduate student or post-doc level are no longer adequate when they become principal investigators of more complex technical projects. Likewise, in transitioning to a program officer role at a funding agency, one may find that one&rsquo;s technical experience is not adequate for developing functional and realistic metrics for project success.

    <h2 class="c2 c8" id="h.rtkadvvyvaul"><span>Research Software Projects</span></h2><h4 class="c2 c8" id="h.djec5033ho1u"><span>Scenarios</span></h4><p class="c2"><span>In this section, we will describe a number of common scenarios where research produces some code or software, and where the expectations for assessment, development process and project maturity, researcher education, and code sustainability will play out differently. </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c22">Scenario 1.</span><span>&nbsp;An individual developing data processing scripts. </span></p><p class="c2 c15"><span>I am a grad student or post-doc without any computer science or software development training and I need to develop some data processing scripts for my analysis. I know these scripts will be made public so I&rsquo;d like try to follow good code practices but don&rsquo;t know where to start.</span></p><p class="c2 c15 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c15"><span>Assessment: The developed scripts are secondary research products where the the desired products are the data and analyses. The code is unlikely to undergo formal review but is expected to meet basic code standards and publication requirements.</span></p><p class="c2 c15 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c15"><span>Maturity: Few expectations for high levels of process maturity although this is dependant on the nature of the scripting. However, since it has data production or analysis as its primary goal, correctness, and demonstrations of that correctness, are expected. </span></p><p class="c2 c15 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c15"><span>Education: Good code practices for clean code and tested code. Accepted publication practices for the community. </span></p><p class="c2 c15 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c15"><span>Sustainability: No ongoing support from the grad student, post-doc or research group is expected if the code is published to an external archive. </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c22">Scenario 2.</span><span>&nbsp;A new </span><span>system</span><span>&nbsp;based on a single grant.</span></p><p class="c2 c15"><span>Our research group is starting a new project to develop an analysis platform as a web application. It will use a well-known JavaScript framework and will be developed in the open. We plan on developing our community to support active contributions and to support the application&rsquo;s adoption in areas where the analysis is useful. </span></p><p class="c2 c15 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c15"><span>Assessment: Verification that the new system meets the research goals and meets expectations to support reuse and adoption. </span></p><p class="c2 c15 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c15"><span>Maturity: Processes must be mature enough to allow external developers to set up a development environment and contribute features or patches. The group considers it beta software so stability is not expected.</span></p><p class="c2 c15 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c15"><span>Education: Guidance on developing and supporting community contributions. Identification of next steps for an operational system.</span></p><p class="c2 c15 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c15"><span>Sustainability: Demonstrations of community activity and successful engagement to show adoption potential.

    <p class="c2"><span class="c22">Scenario 3.</span><span>&nbsp;An existing system with a single grant to add new features.</span></p><p class="c2 c15"><span>Our research group has an existing project, a geospatial processing library. Our grant includes development time for several new features that we&rsquo;ll release as a new major version.</span></p><p class="c2 c15 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c15"><span>Assessment: Needs some understanding of the current status of the system to determine if new features meet the same maturity levels, and there will be concerns if they are lower. Otherwise, evaluate if new features meet stated research goals with the system at or above the initial maturity levels.</span></p><p class="c2 c15 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c15"><span>Maturity: As noted, the maturity of the new features are expected to be at or above the level of the existing system. Process improvements may also occur during the grant cycle.</span></p><p class="c2 c15 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c15"><span>Education: Identification of next steps for an operational system.</span></p><p class="c2 c15 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c15"><span>Sustainability: We could assume this is managed as an open source project where improvements are made with a research goal in mind. Steps towards gaining contributions of funding or effort from other sources have been undertaken.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c22">Scenario 4.</span><span>&nbsp;An existing system with multiple grants, one of which adds a new standalone component.</span></p><p class="c2 c15"><span>We have an existing platform for data access that is currently receiving support from multiple grants. One of the grants is funding an extension to the platform that will be developed as a standalone application (middleware). Our platform is based on an open source project developed by a different group not supported by this funding (we are reusing the OS system as a base for our own efforts).</span></p><p class="c2 c15 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c15"><span>Assessment: Evaluate the standalone component for completeness and functionality at the maturity levels laid out in the grant. Additional evaluation of the integration of the standalone component with the existing system.</span></p><p class="c2 c15 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c15"><span>Maturity: Started at known levels at the start of the grant with no expectations of improvements. </span></p><p class="c2 c15 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c15"><span>Education: Project manager would like information on the assessment criteria based on the stated project goals. </span></p><p class="c2 c15 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c15"><span>Sustainability: Project has reached a stable state, continues to look for adoption at other institutions and funding opportunities.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c22">Scenario 5. </span><span>An existing system with multiple grants, one of which supports a new data product.</span></p><p class="c2 c15"><span>We currently maintain a data portal with legacy code. In our new grant, we are collaborating with other groups, but we are not responsible for the main development tasks. Part of our requirements are to add new data products in support of the larger collaboration. We need to write processing code for those products; the code won&rsquo;t be integrated into our legacy platform and won&rsquo;t be needed long-term.</span></p><p class="c2 c15 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c15"><span>Assessment: Evaluation of the larger collaborative project where the successful generation of the data product is relevant to demonstrate interoperability/integration, but the code itself is not evaluated. </span></p><p class="c2 c15 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c15"><span>Maturity: Has reached some stable maturity levels, but the state of the legacy platform is not relevant to the assessment.</span></p><p class="c2 c15 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c15"><span>Education: Research group would like guidance on automation practices to better support data pipelines in the future.</span></p><p class="c2 c15 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c15"><span>Sustainability: None. Code will be published as an archive for provenance.</span></p>

    <p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c22">Scenario 6. </span><span>A single grant with multiple collaborators providing outputs/functionality through their independent systems.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c15"><span>We are demonstrating a new analysis platform that relies on distributed data sources. One collaboration group is developing the new analysis platform, one is implementing new features in an existing platform and the third developing a data pipeline process. The success of the project depends on the integration of the three systems and the groups are not contributing to one codebase.
</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c15 c9"><span></span></p>
    <p class="c2 c15"><span>Assessment: Assessment at the project level, focusing on the successful integration of the three activities. If the analysis platform is intended for potential reuse, additional assessment may be considered for that component only.
</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c15 c9"><span></span></p>
    <p class="c2 c15"><span>Maturity: The new development, seen in the analysis platform, is expected to meet maturity expectations for a prototype web application while the two data providing systems should work within the maturity level of their existing systems.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c15 c9"><span></span></p>
    <p class="c2 c15"><span>Education: The collaboration groups providing data may want information on the interoperable service implementations. The project collaborators are interested in understanding the assessment process.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c15 c9"><span></span></p>
    <p class="c2 c15"><span>Sustainability: Sustainability is likely relevant only to the analysis platform as the component intended for reuse/adoption, certainly from a funder’s perspective. The two data systems ideally would continue to support the new functionality, as early adopters of the system or to support other downstream activities.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c22">Scenario 7. </span><span>An existing system with a grant specifically to provide maintenance.
</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c15"><span>We are the maintainers of a successful visualization tool that has reached a point in its lifecycle where major refactoring is required to continue to support future activities. The grant doesn’t include any new functionality, but may include upgrades to the language version, bug fixes and refactoring to manage technical debt.
</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c15 c9"><span></span></p>
    <p class="c2 c15"><span>Assessment: </span></p>
    <p class="c2 c15 c9"><span></span></p>
    <p class="c2 c15"><span>Maturity: Expected to remain at the maturity level at the start of the maintenance effort or improve based on the stated goals.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c15 c9"><span></span></p>
    <p class="c2 c15"><span>Education: No explicit education requirements. </span></p>
    <p class="c2 c15 c9"><span></span></p>
    <p class="c2 c15"><span>Sustainability: Project is expected to continue community engagement and support activities (assuming major upgrade) and continue pursuing additional funding, whether through additional maintenance grants or for extending the functionality.
</span></p>



    <p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Hopefully these scenarios</span><span>, while clearly not a comprehensive list of all possibilities,</span><span>&nbsp;provide some insight into how different project types and phases might be assessed. </span></p><h4 class="c2 c8" id="h.x1l28fc1ejv"><span>Development Process and Project </span><span>Maturity</span></h4><p class="c2"><span>Development process maturity and project maturity, identified either through longevity or by some other defined criteria, are not linear, nor do they necessarily coincide. A project can start with a high level of development process maturity in an initial proof of concept phase. For its part, project maturity, often presented as governance patterns similar to traditional open source projects, can begin the same way. Improvements in both can occur within the lifespan of a single grant, or they can happen through a series of grants. Here we can see the potential mismatch between the way that funding agencies often assess and categorize a project and the way that software develops in reality. Additionally, a mismatch between assessment and maturity can occur when, for example, a codebase does not meet the desired level of code maturity or project maturity, but is nevertheless successfully serving a communal need. Maturity markers are indicators of project health, and we strongly encourage their use, but not to the detriment of the larger goals of providing a product that meets a research community&rsquo;s needs.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Within the diversity of research software projects, </span><span>two overarching categories</span><span>&nbsp;can be distinguished that bear on the assessment of maturity: first, code/software intentionally developed for reusability and adoption, and second, code/software developed for highly specific project needs. Neither category can neglect the recent requirements for openness, notably the U.S. Office of Science and Technology Office&rsquo;s policies on Open Science (Holdren, 2013) and the increasing number of academic journals requiring data and code publication; however, the methods used for achieving those requirements, and expectations around development process or project maturity, are different in each category. For projects developing code or software not intended for reuse and adoption, the focus for assessment is on development process maturity, documentation and preservation or publication. (We should note that &ldquo;not intended&rdquo; reflects stated project milestones, sustainability and community engagement activities as per the funded proposal.) For projects developing code or software that is intended for adoption, the focus for assessment is on project maturity related to governance and documentation as well as development process maturity.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>We are focused here on code/software developed by a research group. For the purposes of assessment, we exclude from discussion of maturity any software products reused by a research group,while noting the value in assessing project maturity. More specifically, we support, and encourage, a research group&rsquo;s decision to reuse a current, outcome-appropriate technology over reimplementing a similar technology. We do not, however, consider the reused technology to be an assessment target itself. A simple example is developing modules for an existing web publication framework instead of developing an entirely new framework.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>On a related issue, in cases where a project employs an existing technology to support the publication or release of a research product that is not itself code or software, the pre-existing technology again would not be considered during the assessment of the research software or code. A very broad example of this would be developing datasets and providing them publicly through ESRI&rsquo;s ArcOnline platform. In this case, a project assessment would consider the datasets, but not ArcOnline. (Guidance for quality and maturity for other research product types, such as datasets or ontologies, is beyond the scope of this document.)</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/web-analytics.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1475132047385000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH9BJAk-ac0ey1EasHSSev5Coor2g">Analytics</a></span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1475132047385000&amp;usg=AFQjCNExPLiO4aI3U9ZPTgoOZLQU16bcFA">altmetrics</a></span><span>&nbsp;are included here to highlight two aspects of analytics for assessment. First, projects at different stages of their lifecycles are characterized by different outcomes, and those outcomes may not occur within a specific funding period. Second, our guidance focuses on those activities that a research group can usefully act upon to meet its own maturity goals. The success of these activities may, at least in part, be demonstrated through analytics and altmetrics. Understanding how those metrics relate to funding cycle timelines is necessary before including them in an assessment process focused on activities within a cycle. We suggest caution, then, in interpreting what is being measured, and in being aware of when in the cycle it is being measured.. </span></p><h4 class="c2 c8" id="h.girxi3be7fh7"><span>Systems</span></h4><p class="c2"><span>As exemplified by the scenarios, when we talk about maturity and/or assessment, we are often discussing existing systems maintained by a research group or a larger collaboration. From the funder&rsquo;s perspective, a formal evaluation of existing products is not cost effective; however, there are instances when assessment requires an understanding of the existing system&rsquo;s baseline maturities. We discuss this requirement further in </span><span class="c1"><a class="c4" href="#h.b2e39m7jtud5">Progression</a></span><span class="c22">,</span><span>&nbsp;where the context and research goals of the grant play a role in determining the assessment need. Regardless of assessment requirements, understanding the current state of a project is necessary if a research group wants to evaluate whether process changes are leading to improvements or to regressions. </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>We are not starting with a tabula rasa for research cyberinfrastructure in general or when beginning new grant-funded activities. Nor do we often start cyberinfrastructure projects without taking advantage of existing platforms, frameworks or libraries. There is a need to assess the selection of these dependencies as they relate to the overall project goals, even if we are not evaluating the maturity of the dependencies themselves.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>One final note regarding these systems: technology changes rapidly. Our cyberinfrastructure and research development challenges often require complex solutions, and guiding system architectures is beyond the scope of this document. There is often no single solution for many of our research activities. It is the responsibility of the researcher or research group to investigate current technologies that may address the specific project needs and select those technologies accordingly. Researchers must consider the project requirements, previous efforts, and the pros and cons of available platforms and solutions. </span></p><h2 class="c2 c8" id="h.3qhixgp3adkd"><span>Goals of this Document</span></h2><ol class="c14 lst-kix_shfd0z5borlh-0 start" start="1"><li class="c2 c3"><span>Provide resources and guidance to different kinds of research groups and other stakeholders to support research code/software development within our research communities.</span></li><li class="c2 c3"><span>Provide a progression model and related discussion around sustainability, adoption and reuse, and assessment that reflects the variation in research development products. </span></li></ol><h1 class="c2 c8" id="h.jto1fyx4wiqs"><span>Guidelines</span></h1><p class="c2"><span>Research code, in itself, is not special as code; however, as a product of research funding, it comes with the burdens of reproducibility, publication and preservation.</span><span>&nbsp;The guidelines presented here are intended to help researchers solve problems they encounter while addressing these requirements.

    <p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>The guidance provided below strives to be language- and platform-agnostic. Wherever possible, the examples provided are not an endorsement of a language or product and are intended solely as examples of the larger concept. When choices must be made by a research group on how to implement a concept, we suggest that in almost all cases there are many acceptable paths. Choose one, support it and move on to the project implementation. </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Finally, while we strongly support open science and the principles of accessibility, reproducibility and preservation of research software and code, we acknowledge that there are resource limitations, differing levels of experience and differing needs, both within and among communities. Choice of language, choice of platform, choice of tools&mdash;these are driven by the specific research and community needs rather than any dogmatic adherence to a particular philosophy. </span></p>

It sets expectations for the development and for adopters. </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Tests, like documentation, are only usable if kept up to date. A reasonable criteria for adoption is that a code base does not include failing tests and certainly not failing tests that have been in the code for a long period of time. Code coverage can promote unsustainable practices; we recommend, if nothing else, testing key aspects and integrations. This includes testing for success states as well as exceptions or exceptional conditions. </span></p><h4 class="c2 c8" id="h.qfvkud70t782"><span>Tests limit dependence on external services where possible.</span></h4><p class="c2"><span>Where possible, limit the use of external resources as inputs for the tests.

When discussing accessibility in this section, we are referring to the ability of an individual to locate a project and, more importantly, its software or code products. </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>The Geoscience Paper of the Future (Gil et. al 2016) outlines recommended practices and the relationships of research code and software within the larger scholarly ecosystem. Academic journals may also provide guidance on their expectations for research code and software related to accepted papers. Support journals that are signatories of or have implemented the Transparency and Openness Promotion Guidelines (Alter et al. 2016).</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>The ongoing shift towards considering code and software as research products in their own right is a rapidly changing environment. The guidance below starts with currently actionable steps, defaulting to capturing the information in the code repository at least.</span></p><h3 class="c2 c8" id="h.tk3e9fopeigk"><span>Publication and Citation</span></h3><h4 class="c2 c8" id="h.llz3mjenwmpr"><span>Software, as binaries and source code, are published to a sustainable third-party repository.</span></h4><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>This criteria can be met for projects hosting source code in an external VCS platform during development and simply leaving those publicly accessible at the end of the project. </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Some research communities have developed domain-specific software and code registries for publication. </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Other options include depositing software/code and related documentation with your institutional repository. </span></p><h4 class="c2 c8" id="h.42ni1tsctkct"><span>Documentation includes citation details.</span></h4><p class="c2"><span>As noted earlier regarding other metrics for assessing the sustainability (or viability) of a research software package includes impact related to citations.

In some areas, community practices exist; for those areas without, the F11 document provides references for currently used options. Providing citation details is only one part of fully realizing the value of software citations. Citing others&rsquo; code and software you use for your research activities, for datasets or analyses, is part of being a good research citizen.</span></p><h3 class="c2 c8" id="h.pzfz7hkzxqus"><span>Preservation/Archiving</span></h3><p class="c2"><span>As noted in </span><span class="c1"><a class="c4" href="#h.tk3e9fopeigk">Publication and Citation</a></span><span>, depositing a stable or final version in an external repository is the minimum option. Meeting most, if not all, of the documentation guidelines and ensuring that the documentation is deposited with the source code provides a more useful archive. If using certain version control systems, such as GitHub, export and archive all of the metadata related to the repository (wikis, issues, etc). </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Containerization is being explored as another archive option (</span><span class="c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://daspos.crc.nd.edu/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1475132047564000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFFX_hdVzC2bB_pBQNDzYkZlORaQQ">DASPOS</a></span><span>). Here, the software is provided in a runnable container, preserving the system and dependencies. In some cases, this kind of preservation is not possible due to license constraints related to redistribution (for proprietary software, for example).</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Realistically, black box archiving or a container providing only installed or built software is not as future-proof as providing both the source code and documentation archive and a containerized version. Runnable archives address reproducibility and replicability concerns; they do not address other aspects of code that are of value. Code, maintained in its basic text format, is valuable for education and for other research activities as data. </span></p><h3 class="c2 c8" id="h.rdevd43xfrh4"><span>Credit</span></h3><p class="c2"><span>Authorship and credit for software is overlooked in traditional scholarly spaces. Citation is one method for addressing that. Projects such as </span><span class="c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://depsy.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1475132047567000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFMejJFFgxoXBcrSnR9JsGJXnnzdg">depsy</a></span><span>, where transitive credit and contributions are considered, is another. Often these options are limited to certain languages, VCS platforms or package indexes.

That being said, research software and code </span><span>have</span><span>&nbsp;additional expectations as part of the larger scholarly and research community. Traditional open source might be a big hammer for research projects that may not actually </span><span>use</span><span>&nbsp;nails.

Code </span><span>artefacts</span><span>&nbsp;are public with no maintenance expectations.</span></li><li class="c2 c3"><span class="c22">Research Open Source:</span><span>&nbsp;similar to internal open source in that open source practices are used but with no expectations of outside contributions due to community structure,research goals, or research group governance. Critical to support community adoption of the product.</span></li><li class="c2 c3"><span class="c22">Open Source:</span><span>&nbsp;traditional open source with expectations of external contributors.</span></li></ul><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Public Source does not exclude R</span><span>esearch Open Source or Open Source</span><span>&nbsp;and it is possible to meet the Public Source requirements through either Research Open Source or Open Source governance. The key difference is the publication requirement.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Within these three categories, we immediately note the difference between Public Source and the two Open Source categories. Sustainability for Public Source products is most often the responsibility of some external platform, like a domain-specific software repository, a hosted VCS or an institutional archive. The sustainability of the projects developing such products is certainly of concern, but largely out of scope of this discussion.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>We can, based on our stakeholder expectations, speak to sustainability for Research Open Source and Open Source activities. We can suggest activities to support the adoption and growth of a piece of research software, as would be required for its longer term viability, </span><span>but there are no guarantees of success. This is as true of the larger </span><span>O</span><span>pen </span><span>S</span><span>ource community (Eghbal 2016) as it is for research software. Realistically, most projects are unlikely to draw from a large pool of potential contributors, </span><span>which </span><span>limit</span><span>s</span><span>&nbsp;their ability to diversify the contributor base beyond the original research group. This </span><span>limitation </span><span>does not mean that the research goals </span><span>will</span><span>&nbsp;not </span><span>be </span><span>met</span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;nor that the project is not valuable to the audience it is aimed at; it simply means that we cannot expect high levels of external contributions to sustain future development efforts. </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>We are faced again with a situation that does not provide a single solution. </span><span>Furthermore</span><span>, without a comprehensive understanding of the research development landscape, it is irresponsible to suggest that there is one. But we can consider sustainability in three broad areas, with an eye towards a healthy research development culture and broader impacts.</span></p><h4 class="c2 c8" id="h.ytbqx2fpn94q"><span>Sustainability based on potential</span></h4><p class="c2"><span>For projects in early phases, e.g. proofs of concept or prototypes, sustainability may be more accurately called opportunity, i.e. whether the project has met its research goals and whether it is being managed in such a way to indicate future success. As we described in </span><span class="c1"><a class="c4" href="#h.b2e39m7jtud5">Progression</a></span><span>, one of the goals of these projects is to demonstrate the viability of an implementation. Resources might not be dedicated to supporting activities related to adoption; or, in other cases, adoption is a goal but whether any resources can be used to support adoption will depend on timing. </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Sustainability here can mean either additional funding to operationalize the software, or to provide time to allow for community adoption and reuse. </span></p><h4 class="c2 c8" id="h.7c0vnqsr803n"><span>Sustainability of broadly applicable cyberinfrastructure</span></h4><p class="c2"><span>It is telling that, in conversations about research code or software, we speak of certain open source projects as models for adoption. The kinds of projects we talk about, however, are often not good comparisons. </span><span>We point to data formats</span><span>, database systems, visualization libraries or analysis packages, these more general products, as exemplars for any research code/software open source project. These are products that can be adopted outside the research community.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Discussions around sustainability and sustainability plans are also where open source expectations around community management and engagement play a larger role. Outreach for a project requires resources and effort. The guidelines describe the technologies and platform needs to support community activities; the mere existence of those technologies won&rsquo;t grow a viable community. </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Alternative funding models in the open source community include crowdfunding (one time payments or subscription), foundation funding, or corporate patronage (Eghbal 2016). Of course, pursuing funding outside of federal research grants is also resource-intensive. </span></p><h4 class="c2 c8" id="h.yd76uhfdnc1j"><span>Sustainability of research development</span></h4><p class="c2"><span>What about development that cannot be broadly adopted across research communities or beyond? Here, we are talking about t</span><span>hose projects that </span><span>develop domain-specific products such as models, those that develop and maintain citizen science applications for ongoing data collection, or those that provide infrastructure for data or analysis.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>In some cases, a high priority goal is to have the product integrated into an agency&rsquo;s operational systems. </span><span>Reaching this goal however </span><span>does not guarantee </span><span>that there will be </span><span>ongoing maintenance support.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>The alternative funding models listed for open source projects may be applicable here as well. Anecdotal stories from the open source community, particularly </span><span>stories involving </span><span>patronage (</span><span>monies from a </span><span>foundation, </span><span>whether </span><span>corporate or other</span><span>wise</span><span>), describe limitations on that funding</span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;suggest</span><span>ing that</span><span>&nbsp;these models may not be effective long-term solutions (Eghbal 2016). If the patronage model revolves around funding specific features </span><span>that are </span><span>required by the patron, one must consider the larger research goals of the project</span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;both in terms of the available resources for the maintenance of those features</span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span>in terms of </span><span>the philosophical underpinnings of the project. </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>It is, then, a question for our research communities as to how we develop sustainable funding models for projects that cannot make the transition from research product to a more widely applicable product, projects that are nonetheless successful in supporting valuable science and research activities.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Finally, concepts recommended for sustainability related to financial support are also valuable within a research group. That is, for groups that rely heavily on potentially transient contributors (like graduate students and post-docs) for development activities, internal project governance and solid documentation can provide some stability for projects and improve the transitions to new research staff. </span></p><h3 class="c2 c8" id="h.hftwhr372i88"><span>Adoption</span><span>&nbsp;and</span><span>&nbsp;Reuse</span></h3><p class="c2"><span>This discussion centers around research software as that set of products aimed for use beyond the original research group. This may be presented as infusion; here we will consider two aspects that fall under that larger concept: adoption (by consumers) and reuse (by developers). For funders, the distinction is not important; for researchers and research groups, the distinction can help clarify what monitoring and other metrics they may need to collect based on the project&rsquo;s goals for infusion. We also consider the timing of the infusion signals in the metrics, both in term of the software phase and of the grant cycle. </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>We don&rsquo;t have research to describe growth rates or patterns in adoption of open source </span><span>research software as applications or as reusable modules</span><span>. This obviously makes it difficult to provide timeframes for assessing these metrics for a project. In some cases, it may be possible to evaluate some infusion metrics by project grant&rsquo;s end, for instance, if the release occurred well within the grant. For projects that release software products late in the funding cycle, there is simply no time to grow. This is as true for analytics as it is for altmetrics. </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>To provide some flexibility in assessing infusion that is aware of these timing concerns, we offer three general phases (durations are estimated and refer to the time since public release):</span></p><ol class="c14 lst-kix_pe1x2tciq74l-0 start" start="1"><li class="c2 c3"><span>Early phase (&lt;6 months): analytics provides little information, perhaps capturing early adopters or known project collaborators.</span></li><li class="c2 c3"><span>Middle phase (6 months &lt; 18 months): analytics show active growth (adoption and/or reuse) and some sustained use. Potential altmetrics activity.</span></li><li class="c2 c3"><span>Advanced phase (&gt; 18 months): analytics show continued growth, if limited, but sustained active user base (adoption and/or reuse). Altmetrics activity expected.</span></li></ol><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>We do not provide any expectations of scale in these phases as these must be considered in terms of the research goals and the communities being served. For example, the adoption of a hydrology model will display different characteristics than would a citizen science data collection web application. These considerations become one more aspect of of our larger context-driven approach, tied to progression, to product type, to research goals, that need to be addressed to support equitable and realistic assessment efforts when addressing &ldquo;time to science&rdquo; and ROI from the funder&rsquo;s perspective. </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Returning to research code specifically, we want to consider adoption and reuse not necessarily of the code as the primary concern but of the dataset generated or analysis performed using that code. Here again, the research code is a secondary output but one that is still very key to the research goals. The code&rsquo;s impact is tied to the impact of the dataset and it&rsquo;s this situation where the value of strong cultural practices around software and data citation as well as use and quality analyses using provenance traces (Car 2016) comes to the forefront. How we value those measures for code as secondary outputs is an open question.</span></p><h1 class="c2 c8" id="h.gpan0aidj5ex"><span>Using this guidance for assessment</span></h1><p class="c2"><span>We have touched upon assessment throughout this document as we describe some of the ways that development intersects with our research environments and practices. We have touched on the various stakeholder expectations, development progression and maturity, sustainability and infusion, and the guidelines themselves. These provide a foundation for implementing an assessment instrument when taking into account the different stakeholder needs and different community needs, although providing an explicit model to address each is outside the scope of this document.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>We will, however, provide a core model to reflect the minimum set of criteria for any research development product to meet:</span></p><ol class="c14 lst-kix_xcfwdxntv4m-0 start" start="1"><li class="c2 c3"><span>Sustainable Code</span></li></ol><ol class="c14 lst-kix_xcfwdxntv4m-1 start" start="1"><li class="c2 c18 c29"><span>Clean, standardized code</span></li><li class="c2 c18 c29"><span>Versioned code</span></li><li class="c2 c18 c29"><span>Tested* (strongly recommended)</span></li></ol><ol class="c14 lst-kix_xcfwdxntv4m-0" start="2"><li class="c2 c3"><span>Documented</span></li></ol><ol class="c14 lst-kix_xcfwdxntv4m-1 start" start="1"><li class="c2 c18 c29"><span>Source code is documented.</span></li><li class="c2 c18 c29"><span>The codebase includes documentation to support adoption and reuse.</span></li></ol><ol class="c14 lst-kix_xcfwdxntv4m-0" start="3"><li class="c2 c3"><span>Sharable</span></li></ol><ol class="c14 lst-kix_xcfwdxntv4m-1 start" start="1"><li class="c2 c18 c29"><span>Code is licensed.</span></li></ol><ol class="c14 lst-kix_xcfwdxntv4m-0" start="4"><li class="c2 c3"><span>Code as Research Products</span></li></ol><ol class="c14 lst-kix_xcfwdxntv4m-1 start" start="1"><li class="c2 c18 c29"><span>Publication and Citation</span></li></ol><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>These cover the basic requirements to support open science activities. </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>We err here in favor of externally verifiable indicators for any assessment task, whether that assessment is done in-house or through a more formal process. In some cases, these indicators will support other sustainability and adoption goals. For most assessment, such as those done by by a funding agency, sustainability and adoption/reuse are often the only metrics of interest for evaluating a piece of research software.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>There are also recommended practices, invisible to this kind of external review, for improving code quality. Code reviews, pair programming, Agile or Lean management practices&mdash;these activities can be difficult to discern from the project </span><span>artefacts</span><span>&nbsp;that we consider in the guidance above. While there are practices described there that are commonly used in Agile management, for example, we are not advocating any one management style. We are, rather, noting that there are processes involved in the development of these products that are difficult or impossible to assess at a project&rsquo;s end or at all. </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>For those wishing to use these guidelines for assessing research products for adoption or reuse, we n</span><span>ote that there is no one measure for fitness of use provided by these guidelines. Each researcher or research group must weigh their own project&rsquo;s goals and resources (every dependency is a maintenance cost) when evaluating these products for reuse. We do not recommend the use of these guidelines alone when evaluating projects for adoption as development process maturity is not the most relevant measure of whether a research product is a worthwhile tool to add to your research workflow.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>
        Returning to our scenarios, we would like to address concerns around just what is likely to be assessed. We are not speaking for any funders in this; however, we all recognize that it is simply not feasible to review every code/software product and that no one assessment effort will address the different stakeholder needs and expectations. From the ESIP community, we place efforts to improve the technical capabilities of our researchers and research groups as key to approaching the underlying concerns found in the most frequently discussed needs for assessment: “rigor” in code-dependent research activities (from the research community) and return on investment or “time to science” (from the funding agencies).
    </span></p>

    <h1 class="c2 c8" id="h.aep6uf41nqbc"><span>Conclusions</span></h1><p class="c2"><span>These, or any code/software, guidelines alone reflect only one aspect of a research project involving code or software development. We never want to lose sight of the research goals in favor of a purely technical answer. That is, from the viewpoint of a developer, the fastest way to reduce &ldquo;time to science&rdquo; and one that disregards the necessities of our research communities. Our research activities rely heavily on code and, while code is code and these guidelines reflect that understanding, we do have additional expectations of this code because it is written for research activities. We expect rigor, inspection, trust. To promote that, we need to support our communities and provide the education and training to produce, manage and understand the code/software throughout the research lifecycle.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span>We will end with one final note. This document is as much about creating a shared understanding around what it takes to produce research code/software. We are not advocating that every researcher must also be a trained software engineer. It is more important that our researchers have the technical literacy and knowledge to understand how code supports their research, the limitations of code and the ways in which it can fail. Those that continue to code and continue to learn have our support. But those that don&rsquo;t continue on that path may still have active roles in shaping the technologies that we create. That may include product owners (for those working in an Agile system), project managers, domain researchers, principal investigators, or federal program officers. When we consider the ways in which producing code and software has grown more complex, in terms of technologies and in the number of skillsets required, we cannot ignore the very real need to better support interdisciplinary teams and more collaborative approaches to research development. We start by building these shared understandings of our research development activities so that we can better support our research communities.</span></p><h1 class="c2 c8" id="h.qyi0cpttkurs"><span>Contributors</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c22">ESIP</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Valerie Toner (NOAA)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>James Gallagher (OPeNDAP)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Robert Downs (CIESIN)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Anne Wilson (LASP)<br>Kim Kokkonen (LASP)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Joshua Elliott (LASP)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Chris Pankratz (LASP)<br>Ruth Duerr (Ronin Institute)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Ryan Bowe (Geospatial Metadata)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Chris Kotfila (Kitware)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Leslie Hsu (USGS)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Sam Silva (MIT)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Bon Simons (NOAA)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Ben Barton (University of Alaska Fairbanks)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Tina (?)</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c22">EarthCube/ESIP Software Assessment Workshop, June 1-3, Boulder, CO</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Anne Wilson (LASP)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Emily Law (JPL NASA)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Ken Keiser (UAL-H)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Aleksandar Jelenak (The HDF Group)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Nathan Hook (NCAR-CISL)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Ward Fisher (UCAR/Unidata)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Bob Arko (UNOLS/R2R)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Adam Shephard (WHOI)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Matt Tricomi (Xentity)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lindsay Powers (The HDF Group)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Arika Virapongse (University of Florida)</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span></span></p>
